# 100 - Installation

The first step is to install Home Assistant. We recommend a dedicated system to run Home Assistant. If you are unsure of what to choose, follow [the Raspberry Pi guide](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi) to install **Home Assistant Operating System**.

Home Assistant offers four different installation methods. We recommend using one of the following two methods:

- **Home Assistant Operating System**: Minimal Operating System optimized to power Home Assistant. It comes with Supervisor to manage Home Assistant Core and Add-ons. Recommended installation method.

- **Home Assistant Container**: Standalone container-based installation of Home Assistant Core (e.g. Docker).

There are two alternative installation methods available for experienced users:

- **Home Assistant Supervised**: Manual installation of the Supervisor.

- **Home Assistant Core**: Manual installation using Python virtual environment.

The list below shows the installation method available based on the device and platform being used.

If you are using the [Home Assistant Blue](https://www.home-assistant.io/blue), the Home Assistant Operating System is already installed. [Continue to onboarding](https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/home-assistant/tree/main/300/100/200).
